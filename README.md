# Coffee-Order-Analysis
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze and understand the sales performance of a coffee business by examining various factors such as coffee type, roast type, and regional preferences. The dataset contains detailed records of coffee orders. The aim is to identify key insights and trends, such as the most popular coffee types, preferred roast levels, and sales distribution across different countries. By creating a comprehensive dashboard, the project seeks to provide actionable conclusions that can guide strategic decisions to optimize sales and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Report


## Conclusion
The analysis reveals Excelsa as the top-selling coffee type, with large roast being the most popular. The United States leads in sales, with Arabica and medium roast being the preferred combination. There's also potential to expand the loyalty program, as many customers do not currently have a loyalty card.
