## Conclusion
The analysis reveals Excelsa as the top-selling coffee type, with large roast being the most popular. The United States leads in sales, with Arabica and medium roast being the preferred combination. There's also potential to expand the loyalty program, as many customers do not currently have a loyalty card.
